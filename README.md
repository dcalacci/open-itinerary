Open Itinerary
==============
An [Unhackathon 2014](http://www.unhackathon.org/) project.

Open Itinerary is a website that allows users to easily create travel
itineraries and then share them with friends.

It also allows users to get suggested places near their existing destinations and
along the route between their destinations.
